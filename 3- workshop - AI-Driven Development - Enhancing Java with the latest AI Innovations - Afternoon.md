# Afternoon: **Building Intelligent Java Applications with Langchain4j**

### **Workshop Duration: 3-4 hours**

---

## **Introduction (15-20 minutes)**

- **Welcome and Overview**
  - Brief introduction of the instructors and agenda.
  - Goals of the workshop: Understanding how to use Langchain4j with Java.
  - Overview of Langchain4j, its purpose, and how it fits into the broader AI/Java ecosystem.

- **What is Langchain4j?**
  - Brief explanation of Langchain4j.
  - How it helps build intelligent applications in Java.
  - Use cases in real-world applications.

## **Part 1: Setting Up the Development Environment (20-30 minutes)**

- **Prerequisites**:
  - Tools needed: Java 11+, Maven, IDE (like IntelliJ or VSCode), Docker.
  - Cloning the demo repository: `jdubois-langchain4j-demo`.
  
- **Project Walkthrough**:
  - Go over the project structure.
  - Explanation of dependencies (Langchain4j, OpenAI API, etc.).

- **Hands-On Setup**:
  - Guide participants through setting up the project locally.
  - Running the initial demo app.

## **Part 2: Understanding Langchain4j Components (30-40 minutes)**

- **Chains and Prompts**:
  - Explanation of the role of chains in Langchain4j.
  - How prompts are used to interact with large language models (LLMs).
  - Walkthrough of a simple chain from the demo.

- **Hands-On Activity**: 
  - Modify a simple chain to experiment with different prompts.
  - Discuss how prompt design affects model outputs.

## **Part 3: Building Custom Chains and Integrations (45-60 minutes)**

- **Creating Custom Chains**:
  - How to extend Langchain4j to build custom chains.
  - Discuss the integration with external APIs and tools.

- **Hands-On Activity**:
  - Task: Build a custom chain that integrates with a third-party API (e.g., fetch data and process it using an LLM).
  - Review and discuss different approaches participants used.

## **Part 4: Deploying Langchain4j Applications (30-45 minutes)**

- **Dockerizing the Application**:
  - Introduction to containerizing Java applications.
  - Explanation of the Dockerfile in the demo repository.

- **Hands-On Deployment**:
  - Task: Containerize the custom Langchain4j application using Docker.
  - Deploy the container locally or to the cloud (Azure/other services).

## **Part 5: Optimizing and Scaling Langchain4j (30-40 minutes)**

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Discuss scaling strategies for Langchain4j applications.
  - Caching, request optimizations, and other best practices.

- **Hands-On Activity**:
  - Task: Implement caching for repetitive API calls or improve the application's performance with a specific strategy.

## **Part 6: Q&A, Recap, and Next Steps (15-20 minutes)**

- **Q&A Session**:
  - Open floor for participant questions.

- **Recap of Key Concepts**:
  - Review of chains, custom integrations, and deployment.
  - Final thoughts on using Langchain4j for AI-powered Java applications.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Resources for further learning (official docs, community forums).
  - Encouragement to continue experimenting with Langchain4j beyond the workshop.
