# AI-Driven Development: Enhancing Java with the Latest AI Innovations

Welcome! This repo is a companion for the workshop "AI-Driven Development: Enhancing Java with the Latest AI Innovations." To ensure a smooth and productive session, please refer to the [workshop prerequisites](0%20-%20Workshop%20Prerequisites.md) before beginning.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into three main parts:

### [Part 1: Enhancing Spring Applications with Spring AI](1%20-%20Enhancing%20Spring%20applications%20with%20Spring%20AI.md)

Learn how to integrate AI capabilities into Spring Boot applications using Spring AI and Azure OpenAI:

- Setting up Spring AI with Azure OpenAI Service
- Implementing basic AI integration ("Hello World")
- Creating parameterized prompts
- Working with structured AI outputs
- Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system

### [Part 2: Java Development Using GitHub Copilot](2%20-%20Java%20development%20using%20GitHub%20Copilot.md)

Leverage GitHub Copilot to accelerate your Java development workflow:

- Installing and configuring GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- Redeeming GitHub Pro (if needed)
- Using effective prompts to generate Spring code
- Creating controllers, tests, and documentation with AI assistance
- Implementing new features in existing codebases

### [Part 3: Building Intelligent Java Applications with LangChain4j](3-%20Building%20Intelligent%20Java%20Applications%20with%20Langchain4j.md)
